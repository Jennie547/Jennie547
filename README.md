![I LOVE PROGRAMMING](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LInxR3KRtSs/XFx3c4K4RFI/AAAAAAAAgpY/flcekx9deTYEH59n62lbeoNuiC2S4GhEACLcBGAs/s400/I%2BLove%2BProgramming%2B%2528Animated%2BGIF%2529.gif)


Welcome to my project hub! I tackle various mini projects and assignments using a range of programming and other languages, including Bash, HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, C, Java, and Python.

I am currently an SE student at ALX institution, focusing on software engineering, which involves studying computer software and interacting with computers.

## Learning Journey at ALX

- Started with basic shell commands and Linux operations.
- Progressed to Git and GitHub, mastering branching and collaboration.
- Explored the intricacies of the low-level programming language C.
- Currently delving into Python after overcoming a few deferrals.

## Challenges and Skills

During my course, I embraced challenges on platforms like Hackerrank. Additionally, I dedicated time to learning web development, covering HTML, CSS, JS, and React, with plans to tackle Django in the near future.
